To run the Rubik's cube rendering type the next lines in the terminal:
1) make
2) cd bin
3) ./main [size]
[size] is an int parameter about the size of the Rubik's cube in default size=3.

Color picking was not implemented and instead we implemented some of the bonuses accumulating a potential of 101 points.
